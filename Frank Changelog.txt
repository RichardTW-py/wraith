Frank Changelog June 2014

modifed tree names to have vamas comments, no placeholders

add line color to Spectrum class, color assigned on first line draw

add preprocessing checkbox, corrects dead time count ranges for Omicron 7 channel data
    also corrects FRR FAT (CRR CAR) data to Hz/eV resolution
    background works pretty well for corrected CRR, CRR and CAE scale, small loss of counts
    with retardation

add spin box for smoothing instead of text

change DataHolder class to SpectraFile class

change Pyside to PyQt for anaconda
    this required replacing PySide.QtCore with PyQt4.Qt4, etc
    also Signal() class in PySide not in PyQt4, pyqtSignal() works
	...and change it back to PySide for compatibility with Ed Bs efforts
	     
July
	get running with Anaconda (Win7 OS X both)
	use with Eclipse/Pydev
	
	several style changes to satisfy IDE (sorry Aaron)
		4 space indent
		restrict some imports
		replace some reserved variable names like 'file'
		
	for background fitting change data offset from min(spectrum) to spectrum[-1]
		this respects physical model, min can go low at low kinetic energy due to 
		spectrometer transmission function
		
	change Tougaard abstract background to physical background E_loss, R_loss
		E_loss is mean loss in eV, ~ 10 - 80, Tougaard best 63.6
		R_loss is ratio zero loss to single loss, ~ 0.8 to 1.0 Tougaard 0.872
		B*T/(C+T**2)**2
		C -> 4*dE_ave/pi**2 
		B -> 8*R_loss*dE_ave
		
	update Edit Parameters dialog to use QDoubleSpinBoxes for limits and value
		some issues with recursive updates during build. Per Nick's suggestion first dynamically
		build dialog THEN attach signals.
		
	found out why no tool tips are displayed on sub-menus, "feature" of Qt 4, tool tips for widgets
		but menu actions not widgits....status line tips DO work.
		
	add Clear files action to menus, to close (remove plots, remove from tree) a file without 
		quitting/restarting Wraith. Item added but causes problems with model/view, maybe
		saved reference to list invisible root???
		
		maybe better to have a way to remove a single file
		
	to better support eclipse, reorganize wraith.py since debugger cannot reload main()
		wraith is now minimal module to create Gui message loop, etc
		move SpectraFile to spectrum_handling, (later may put Spectrum here...)
		move Form() to wraith_main_window, (later may split up, mixes GUI and fitting stuff)

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Data Tree Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++
	Form keeps dict { base_name, SpectraFile }
		Spectrum objects loaded from SpectraFile's
			each SF has two lists of treenames and Spectrum objects
				should these be dict? or list of tuples? or in QModel?
				
				
	More powerful use of AbstractItemModel
		root/files/spectra/fits-peaks
		subclass model, store file names and spectra inside\
		item data roles include DisplayRole (text) DecorationRole (plot color)
		could add backgrounds, fits as children of spectra
		
		display same model as table, with plot energy, signal offsets, scales, colors, etc
		
		save/restore model
		
		drag/drop to create new files..., new models...
			open file adds rows, delet row closes files, 
		
		
		
+++++++++++++++++++++++
To Fix
+++++++++++++++++++++++

	still need spec name on Edit Parameters dialog window, so not all identical...
	
	when file is opened, menu is rebuilt, existing plots/check boxes get out of synch. 
		need to be more subtle in adding/removing files, also way to update files during acquisition,
		so if file loaded with 15 spectra then reloaded with 17, plots/checks not changed....
		
	Parameter dialogs stay in scope when fits cleared...they also need per-item labels
	
	Can add context QMenu to tree list items, add QActions to menu
		could include clear peaks, bg, delete file, change color, change text...
